# Image-Compressor-Tool
Efficiently compress and decompress image files with the Image Compression Tool, a MATLAB-based utility designed for simplicity and effectiveness. This tool streamlines the compression process by providing a user-friendly interface for selecting and processing multiple image files in one go.


**Key Features**
Select and process multiple image files in one go.
Choose compression quality for each image (0-100) with user-friendly prompts.
Select the output format (e.g., PNG, JPEG, BMP) for the compressed images.
Visualize original images, grayscale versions, compressed magnitudes, and final compressed images.
Calculate and display file sizes before and after compression.
Easily convert compressed images back to their original state using IFFT.

**Usage**
Run the MATLAB code.
Select the images you want to compress.
Choose compression quality and output format for each image.
Observe the compression results and conversion options.
Optionally save compression details as a MAT file.

**Installation**
This tool requires MATLAB and the MATLAB Image Processing Toolbox.
